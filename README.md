## Overview
This challenge is building a card-layout using HTML and CSS. Since there are no
animations and user interactions with components, I haven't used any javascript.
Also, the style is simple therefore I haven't felt the need to use scss and preprocessors.

## My process
-determine what markup to use for components and structure the content
-global styles specific ones

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

while working through this project, I found it difficult to center a <div class='card'> and that
took me some googling. I found out that the best way to do it is using flexbox.

body {
  display: flex
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

### Useful resources

- [card-layout](https://csslayout.io) - This helped me findout the markup to use for the card-layout. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [center a div](https://www.developer.mozilla.org) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to center a div. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
